Contains:

	42 white matter tract atlases derived using XTRACT for the human (HCP and UK Biobank) and macaque (6 macaques) brain.

	Connectivity blueprint atlases for the human (HCP) and macaque brain. Tracts included in the connectivity blueprint are listed in the "blueprint_tracts" file


Tract atlases are generated by thresholding standard space waytotal normalised path distributions at a threshold value. Subject-wise binarised masks are then cohort-averaged to produce a probabilistic atlas for each tract. *_tracts_1 are generated using a threshold value of 0.1% and *_tracts_5 are generated using a threshold value of 0.5%. Macaque_tracts are generated using a threshold value of 0.1%.

The connectivity blueprint atlases are generated by averaging across each cohort.
